This code was a part of a presentation on the relationship between physics and economics.

I argued that the Bose-Einstein Condensation, network theory, is the phase transition observed in complex networks that
can be described with the same mathematical model as the explaining Bose-Einstein condensation in
physics.

Therefore, an analogy can be made between the mathematics of the network and the mathematics of a Bose
gas if each node in the network were thought of as an energy level, and each link as a particle. This
has implications for real situations including financial markets.
